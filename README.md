# Heart-Failure-Classification

# Statement

**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.**

# Data Dictionary

* age = Age in years
* anaemia = Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
* creatinine_phosphokinase = Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
* diabetes = If the patient has diabetes (boolean)
* ejection_fraction = Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
* high_blood_pressure = If the patient has hypertension (boolean)
* platelets = Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
* serum_creatinine = Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
* serum_sodium = Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
* sex = Woman or man (binary)
* smoking = If the patient smokes or not (boolean)
* time = Follow-up period (days)
* DEATH_EVENT = If the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean) **target**
